# Using the Bayes' Theorem, estimate a "naive" vaccince effectiveness parameter. (Bonus: why is it naive? :-))
# That is, estimate the conditional probability of being hospitalized
# given the individual is fully vaccinated.
# Do the same analysis for the probability of being taken to an ICU given 
# vaccination. 

# ----------------------------------------------------------- #
# Hint: Bayes' Theorem = >
# P(H|V) ... Probability of being hospitalized (icu) given state of being fully vaccinated.
# P(V|H) ... Probability of being vaccinated given hospitalization.
# P(H) ... Probability of being hospitalized
# P(V) ... Probability of being vaccinated.

# == > P(H|V) = [P(V|H) * P(H)] / P(V) 
# == > P(H|V) = [P(V|H) * P(H)] / [P(V|H) * P(H) + P(V | not H) * P(not H)

# The most naive version would be:
# P(V|H) = (number of vaccinated covid patients in hospital) / (covid patients)
# P(H) = (number of covid patients in hospital) / (population)
# P(V) = (number of fully vacinated) / (population)

# ----------------------------------------------------------- #
# To successfully master this assignment you should write a function (comparable to the OLS we did in class)
# that does this analysis for you and presents you with the parameter estimate of interest stored in a 
# vector or list.
# The function should be able to deal with missings! Run in the presence of missings.
#
# Do this analysis for each "7 day moving window" from the start of 
# data availability to the most recent date available.
# Use data at the Bezirks-Level (State level of Bezirk is not available) and then pool the analysis.
# Plot the results in a nice ggplot.

# ----------------------------------------------------------- #
# Think about assumptions:
# Which data to use for which argument (e.g. valid vaccination certificates as opposed to number of vaccinations,
#                                              only fully vaccinated,
#                                              how to treat recovered people?)
# and interpretation of the parameter estimate.

# Grading: 
# Each submission is subject to random selection in order to be 
# presented by the authors. If the authors are not able to present the 
# assignment, 0 points are awarded. 
# Given that there were some unfortunate issues of within group cooperation, 
# you're free to choose your co-authors for this homework.

# Extra Points:
# Bootstrap your parameter-estimates within each 7-day moving window to
# obtain bootstrapped confidence intervals.
